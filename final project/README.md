# **affrm** (tm)

## What the fork is your project?

I built a nice little website that shows you affirmations after you click a button and while this may seem really simple and quite honestly elementary, the learning curve was very steep. On the page itself, there is a logo, description, affirmation generator, and message at the bottom of the page. 

## What on earth did you learn? 

I started off with a Codecademy course in JavaScript and after learning some basic skills, I moved on to learning a little bit of CSS and HTML to get my webpage up and running. Throughout this process I went from knowing nothing about any of those three languages to being able to perform basic commands that would aid in making my webpage work. This included formatting, syntax, and creating functions among others. I also made a button - which was new to me, that drew from an array of affirmations that were stored in a .txt file.

## How can we try this thing?
