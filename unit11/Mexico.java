/* Dice game name: MEXICO
 * Each player starts the game with 6 lives. In the first round, all players take their turn 
 * and roll the 2 dice. Each player’s score in that round is simply the sum of both dice. The 
 * player with the lowest roll in that turn loses a life and has to change his personal dice 
 * accordingly (from 6 to 5 in the first round). The game is continued and each round a player 
 * loses a life. When a player has lost all his or her lives, that player no longer 
 * participates in the game. The game ends when there is only one player left and all other 
 * players have lost all of their lives.
