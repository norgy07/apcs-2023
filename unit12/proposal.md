# Project Proposal: Web App to maintain AFC #hashcodes

The AFC community outreach program produces a periodic [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyCfUrk4by9SqNUStuE6JU2Bz7ofb3orshPpcCiHxfY/edit?usp=sharing).  Existing software reads case notes recorded by outreach personnel, which include hashtags representing data they would like to report on.  For example, `#jobapp` translates to "Job applications prepared for clients" in the "Services" section of the report.

As these are sometimes invented, we need a tool to indicate which hashtags belong to which section of the report, and what the decoded report line should say.  For this project, I will build a web application to enable outreach personnel to create, update, and otherwise mantain hashtags, their section, and decoding.

The webapp will maintain the hashtag data in persistant storage, somewhere.

## Decomposition

This project involves the following steps:
1. Design a user interface for managing the hashtag data
2. Build a webapp to enable editing hashtags
3. Identify solution for storing data
4. Hook up persistant storage to the webapp
5. Deploy the application somewhere, and release to users.

## I will learn

- The [Svelte web framework](https://learn.svelte.dev/) 
- Hosting, for web and data
- Continuous Integration, to deploy my app to a web host.

# Project Proposal: Effirm

The US is facing a [mental health](https://mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america) crisis with about 21% of adults in the US experiencing a mental illness and 10% of youth suffering 
from depressive episodes. This illustrates the need for healthy practices that improve indidvidual cognitive states. Psychologists and scientists have deducted that positive affirmations
are step in the path to ending this issue and fostering a healthy nation. 

Affirmations can, however, be difficult to conduct on your own and without prompting. So, this web app will work to help people in their health journey. 

### Decomposition

This project will require the following:

+ Utilize data sets of affirmations
+ Use HTML to set up a web app
+ Use CSS to set layout of the web app
+ Use JavaScript to control elements 
+ Design a user interface to display generated affirmations

I will learn:

+ The Svelte framework
+ Hosting
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ How to create a functioning web appliction
